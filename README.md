# CodeDoodles

Welcome to `CodeDoodles`! This repository is my personal sandbox for various small, fun, and experimental coding projects. Think of it as a digital sketchbook where I practice, explore new concepts, and sometimes just doodle with code when inspiration strikes (or when I'm bored!).

Here you'll find:

* **Quick Exercises:** Solutions to coding challenges and algorithmic puzzles.
* **Mini Applications:** Small, self-contained programs like simple games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe), utilities, or console tools.
* **Concept Explorations:** Code snippets demonstrating new programming concepts, syntax, or libraries I'm learning.
* **Hobby Projects:** Just for fun projects that don't fit into a larger portfolio.

This repo aims to be:

* **Lightweight:** Projects are typically small, focusing on a single idea.
* **Diverse:** Expect a mix of languages and topics as I continue to learn and grow.
* **Progress-Oriented:** A reflection of my continuous learning journey in programming.

Feel free to browse, learn, or even get inspired for your own code doodles!
